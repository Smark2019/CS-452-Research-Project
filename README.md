# CS-452-Research-Project
CS 452 Research Project on stock price analysis.
This data science class project is proposed that focuses on risk analysis of tech stocks. The project will use data science techniques to analyze the risk associated with investing in tech stocks, specifically by performing an exploratory analysis of stock data from Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and using machine learning algorithms to develop models that can predict future stock prices and assess the risk associated with different investment strategies.
